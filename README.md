# TUI-Bank-Client
This project had been created by an important TUI method which is command method means bank clerk when start he/she will see a list of command with keywords and in the last line “Type Your Command:> “ will appear and clerk must type an valuable keyword, the good point in here is that program created in way that doesn’t crash and give clerk errors by typing wrong keywords, on other hand clerk doesn’t worry about errors in the whole program, even if the internet connection has problems, at the program launch! This it a big point and advantage. The other advantage is that the program or client is colorful, and the clerk won’t be tired during the performance! The client doesn’t care about the way you type it means if you type “exit” or “eXiT” client see them in same way and understand that you want to exit! (not a case sensitivity)
